# Rivure

> Embedded billing infrastructure that keeps product state and financial state in one transaction.

A headless billing engine for Elixir products that cannot afford drift between what the application believes and what the ledger says. External billing APIs push core commercial truth across a network boundary and leave teams with duplicate models and permanent reconciliation work. **Rivure** keeps subscriptions, usage, invoices, wallets, payments, and webhooks inside the host application's own data and transaction model, with provider effects handled as recoverable operations.

Unit economics as an architectural constraint: the margin is recorded in the same transaction as the feature that earned it, and every ambiguous provider outcome has a state instead of a support ticket. The engine is designed as open infrastructure.

*Billing that cannot drift from the product it bills.*
